# October 6, 2025 If you were in charge of your school, what would your technology and AI policy be? Think about things like cell phones, Chromebooks, AI tools (like ChatGPT), and online games. Should games be blocked, or should certain ones (like math or learning games) be allowed? In 5–7 sentences, explain your rules and why you think they would make school better. As head of the school I'd make sure our tech policy really pushes tools to help with learning but cuts down on stuff that pulls kids away. Cell phones may be put away until the last few minutes of class so everyone stays on track with the lessons. They can be fully ussable at lunch lunch though. I'd bring in AI things like ChatGPT, treat them as solid helpers for coming up with ideas and digging into research. Still, I'd spend time teaching the right way to use it and about ethics so no one copies and everyone thinks up their own stuff. For chromebooks id say keep anything inapropriate blocked but not every website blocked

Canva interpreted it by making an interactive type of game where you can click on things and it would tell you how the water cycle works. It even made a quiz to test what you have learned. The interactive parts that worked the best were the clouds when you click on them they would actually rain. Something I could improve is the pictures, I feel like they couldve been better.

The main issue comes up when the SNAP program runs short on funding. Then millions of families suddenly lose the help they count on for buying food. This matters a lot since so many folks, including low-income households, kids, and older people, depend on SNAP just to get decent meals. Without that support, food shortages and outright hunger spread fast among those groups. Tech could step in here by building apps or sites that point people toward free meal spots, nearby food pantries, or shops with special deals. Still, there are real hurdles to overcome. Plenty of people lack steady internet, do not own smartphones, or simply struggle with using digital tools well. If I got to design something for this, I would build an app named FoodLink. It would pull up free food options right away based on location. The app would give clear directions to those spots. It would also push out notices about fresh community food events. Even better, it would run without needing constant online connection. That way it reaches folks who cannot always get online.
