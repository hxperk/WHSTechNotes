If you were in charge of your school, what would your technology and AI policy be? Think about things like cell phones, Chromebooks, AI tools (like ChatGPT), and online games. Should games be blocked, or should certain ones (like math or learning games) be allowed? In 5–7 sentences, explain your rules and why you think they would make school better. As head of the school I'd make sure our tech policy really pushes tools to help with learning but cuts down on stuff that pulls kids away. Cell phones may be put away until the last few minutes of class so everyone stays on track with the lessons. They can be fully ussable at lunch lunch though. I'd bring in AI things like ChatGPT, treat them as solid helpers for coming up with ideas and digging into research. Still, I'd spend time teaching the right way to use it and about ethics so no one copies and everyone thinks up their own stuff. For chromebooks id say keep anything inapropriate blocked but not every website blocked

https://water2.my.canva.site/ My prompt was designed to make an interactive learning assignment about the water cycle. Canva interpreted it by making an interactive type of game where you can click on things and it would tell you how the water cycle works. It even made a quiz to test what you have learned. The interactive parts that worked the best were the clouds when you click on them they would actually rain. Something I could improve is the pictures, I feel like they couldve been better.

The main issue comes up when the SNAP program runs short on funding. Then millions of families suddenly lose the help they count on for buying food. This matters a lot since so many folks, including low-income households, kids, and older people, depend on SNAP just to get decent meals. Without that support, food shortages and outright hunger spread fast among those groups. Tech could step in here by building apps or sites that point people toward free meal spots, nearby food pantries, or shops with special deals. Still, there are real hurdles to overcome. Plenty of people lack steady internet, do not own smartphones, or simply struggle with using digital tools well. If I got to design something for this, I would build an app named FoodLink. It would pull up free food options right away based on location. The app would give clear directions to those spots. It would also push out notices about fresh community food events. Even better, it would run without needing constant online connection. That way it reaches folks who cannot always get online.

Being a drone software engineer stands out as a really solid career choice. These professionals develop the essential programs that enable drones to function effectively. In their daily work, these engineers code in languages such as Python and C plus plus. They focus on aspects like controlling flight paths, enabling self navigation, and integrating cameras along with other sensors. That software essentially guides the drone in avoiding various obstacles. It also ensures the device can carry out its assigned tasks without any major issues.When it comes to compensation, drone software engineers in the United States earn an average of about one hundred forty seven thousand five hundred twenty four dollars each year. This figure comes from ZipRecruiter data dated November twenty twenty five. To get into this field, most positions call for a bachelor's degree in computer science or something similar in engineering. If you plan to handle commercial drone activities, obtaining an FAA Part one zero seven Remote Pilot Certificate becomes necessary as well. Personally, this job appeals to me quite a bit. The whole idea of building autonomous systems presents an intriguing challenge. Plus, playing a role in advancements that support areas like search and rescue operations or streamlined delivery services feels truly fulfilling.

I think a self-driving car could end up not stopping for a school bus. The AI training data probably does not cover enough of the varied visual situations for a stopped bus in different times of day, kinds of weather, or types of roads. Cameras and sensors on the car might have trouble detecting things clearly. For instance, flashing red lights could get hidden by glare or fog. The stop arm might only appear at the very last second because of how the car approaches or due to other traffic in the way. On top of that, the AI has to do more than just identify the vehicle as a bus. It must also figure out that the flashing lights and stop arm signal a required stop right away. That kind of interpretation involves complicated rules. Human drivers usually pick it up through real-world practice over time.

For winter break i will have nothing planned.

Over the winter break I used technology in many ways. I used my tv to watch streaming services like Netflix, Disney +, and Hulu. I used my phone to call, watch youtube, and watch tiktok. Lastly I used my computer to make videos and play games.
